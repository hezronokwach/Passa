# Passa Attribution Model Explained

This document details the revenue attribution and distribution model for the Passa platform. It outlines how revenue from ticket sales is systematically shared among event stakeholders, with a primary focus on fairly compensating creators and artists.

## 1. Overview

Passa's attribution model is designed to provide transparent, automated, and fair revenue sharing. When a fan purchases a ticket, the revenue is instantly earmarked for distribution according to a predefined structure. This ensures that artists, creators, the venue/operations team, and the Passa platform all receive their designated shares without delay.

The model is built on two primary layers:
1.  **Event-Level Splits**: The initial, high-level distribution of all revenue generated by an event.
2.  **Creator-Level Splits**: The specific share of the artists' pool that an individual creator receives for their contribution.

## 2. Core Components

### a) `Event` Splits

Every event created on Passa has three main revenue split percentages defined by the organizer:

-   `artistSplit`: The total percentage of revenue allocated to the "artist pool." This entire pool is distributed among all contributing artists and creators.
-   `venueSplit`: The percentage allocated to cover venue costs and other operational expenses.
-   `passaSplit`: A fixed percentage that goes to the Passa platform to cover transaction fees, development, and maintenance.

These three splits must always sum to 100%.

### b) The `Attribution` Table

This is the most critical component for tracking contributions. An `Attribution` record is created to link a user to an event, signifying their official role in that event's success.

Key fields in the `Attribution` model include:

-   `userId`: The ID of the user being credited (can be a creator or a sponsor).
-   `eventId`: The ID of the event they contributed to.
-   `contributionType`: An enum that can be either `CREATIVE` or `SPONSORSHIP`.
-   `sharePercentage`: **This is the most important field for creators.** It represents the percentage of the `artistSplit` pool that the specific creator is entitled to. This value is 0 for sponsors.
-   `submissionId`: (Optional) If the contribution was a piece of content (like a video or graphic), this links to the specific `Submission` record.

## 3. The Calculation Flow

Here is the step-by-step process for calculating a creator's earnings from an event:

1.  **Calculate Total Event Revenue**:
    -   The system first calculates the total gross revenue from ticket sales.
    > `Total Revenue = (Number of Tickets Sold) * (Ticket Price)`

2.  **Calculate the Artist Pool**:
    -   Next, it determines the size of the total pool of money available for all artists and creators based on the `artistSplit` percentage.
    > `Artist Pool = Total Revenue * (event.artistSplit / 100)`

3.  **Calculate Individual Creator's Share**:
    -   Finally, the system calculates the specific creator's earnings by taking their `sharePercentage` from the `Attribution` record and applying it to the `Artist Pool`.
    > `Creator Earnings = Artist Pool * (attribution.sharePercentage / 100)`

## 4. Example Calculation

Let's assume the following:

-   **Event**: Afrochella Festival
-   **Ticket Price**: $50
-   **Tickets Sold**: 1,000
-   **Event Splits**:
    -   `artistSplit`: 70%
    -   `venueSplit`: 20%
    -   `passaSplit`: 10%
-   **Creator**: A videographer named Aisha.
-   **Aisha's `sharePercentage`** (from her `Attribution` record): 15%

**Calculation:**

1.  **Total Event Revenue**:
    > `1,000 tickets * $50/ticket = $50,000`

2.  **Artist Pool**:
    > `$50,000 * (70 / 100) = $35,000`

3.  **Aisha's Earnings**:
    > `$35,000 * (15 / 100) = $5,250`

In this scenario, Aisha would earn **$5,250** for her creative contribution to the event.

## 5. The Role of Sponsorships

Sponsorships are also tracked via the `Attribution` table, but they function differently in the revenue model.

-   When a user sponsors an event, an `Attribution` record is created with `contributionType` set to `SPONSORSHIP`.
-   The `sharePercentage` for a sponsor is always `0`. They do not receive a percentage of ticket sales revenue.
-   The value for sponsors comes from brand visibility (logo placement, mentions) and the on-chain, verifiable record of their support for the event. This helps them track ROI through brand impact rather than direct revenue share.
