4. Create all issues with proper labels

### Method 2: Using Node.js Script Directly

```bash
# Create issues directly
node scripts/create-github-issues.js <github-token> <repo-owner> <repo-name>

# Example
node scripts/create-github-issues.js ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx hezronokwach Passa
```

### Method 3: Using Environment Variables

```bash
# Set environment variables
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
export REPO_OWNER="hezronokwach"
export REPO_NAME="Passa"

# Run the script
./scripts/create-issues.sh
```
