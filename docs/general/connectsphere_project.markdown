## Problem Statement

### Industry Challenges
1. **Events Industry ($120M)**:
   - 35% ticket fraud ($42M annual loss).
   - Artists receive only 15-30% of door revenue due to promoter cuts.
   - High platform fees (15-25%) with zero transparency.
   - No recourse for cancelled events.
2. **Creator Economy ($3.17M by 2029)**:
   - 22.17M internet users consume content, but monetization is fragmented.
   - Brand payment delays (30-90 days) harm creator cash flow.
   - Lack of verifiable engagement metrics inflates marketing costs ($18M annually).
3. **Brand Marketing Inefficiencies**:
   - $2.4M spent on unverifiable influencer campaigns.
   - No direct link between creator content and sales/attendance.
   - High fraud risk from bot followers and fake engagement.

### Opportunity
The $65M annual loss from inefficiencies can be captured by connecting events, creators, and brands in a transparent, web-based platform that ensures fair value distribution.
