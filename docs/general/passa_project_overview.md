## Problem Statement

### Current Industry Challenges

**1. Revenue Distribution Inequity**
- Artists typically receive only 15-30% of ticket revenue after promoter and venue cuts
- Promoters and content creators lack transparent compensation mechanisms
- No automated way to split revenue fairly based on actual contribution

**2. Ticket Fraud Epidemic**
- 35% of event tickets in Kenya are fake or duplicated
- Fans lose money to fraudulent tickets with no recourse
- Venues struggle with capacity management due to fake tickets

**3. Promotional Attribution Issues**
- Content creators promote events but can't prove their impact on sales
- Event organizers can't measure ROI of different promotional channels
- Brand sponsors lack transparency on campaign effectiveness

**4. Payment Delays and Disputes**
- Manual payment processes cause 30-90 day delays
- Disputes over revenue splits are common and costly to resolve
- High transaction fees eat into already thin margins

### Market Opportunity
- **Kenya Events Market**: $120M annually with 40% growth potential
- **Content Creator Economy**: $3.17M projected by 2029 (8.28% CAGR)
