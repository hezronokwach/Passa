# Navigation Structure Update

## Changes Made

### Removed Redundant Page
- **Removed**: `/dashboard/creator/invitations` - Separate invitations page
- **Reason**: Functionality consolidated into unified activity page

### Updated Navigation
- **Before**: 
  - "My Invitations" - View received invitations
  - "My Applications" - View application history
- **After**:
  - "My Activity" - Unified view with tabs for both invitations and applications

## New User Flow

### For Artists/Creators
1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard/creator`)
   - Overview of earnings, submissions, and stats
   - Quick access buttons to key features

2. **Find Work** (`/dashboard/creator/opportunities`)
   - Browse available performance events
   - Apply to perform at events

3. **My Activity** (`/dashboard/creator/applications`)
   - **Invitations Received Tab**: View and respond to organizer invitations
   - **Applications Sent Tab**: Track status of performance applications
   - Direct access to invitation details via modal dialogs

4. **Profile** (`/dashboard/creator/profile`)
   - Manage artist profile and portfolio

### Benefits of Consolidation

#### User Experience
- **Single Source of Truth**: All performance-related activity in one place
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No confusion about where to find invitation information
- **Streamlined Navigation**: Fewer menu items and clearer information architecture
- **Better Context**: See both incoming invitations and outgoing applications together

#### Technical Benefits
- **Less Code Duplication**: Shared components and logic
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single codebase for activity management
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Unified design patterns and interactions
- **Better Performance**: Fewer page loads and redirects

```
